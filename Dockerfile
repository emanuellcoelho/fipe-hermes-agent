# Fipe -- a FIPE and car-market agent, built FROM the plow-hermes-agent base.
#
# No boot, no gateway config, no model wiring here: those are the base's, and
# arrive as a digest bump. This repo adds one thing -- the persona and skills
# of one assistant -- plus the Agent Index reporter and the process timezone.
#
# The tag is an immutable base-<sha> naming one commit of
# plow-pbc/plow-hermes-agent, resolved to a digest, so a moving tag can never
# substitute different bytes under a running agent.

# Which agent this is on the Agent Index. Compose sets this too, and a Plow
# cloud deploy does not: the provisioner only knows AGENT_ID for the variants
# it lists, and a self-published image is not one of them. Without it the
# reporter refuses to guess -- image/s6-overlay/s6-rc.d/agent-index/run parks
# on `sleep 86400` and this agent silently stops reporting usage. It is a fact
# of this variant, not a secret, so it belongs in the image; a host that sets
# its own still wins, because the container environment outranks image ENV.
ENV AGENT_ID=fipe

# Where this image comes from, who may use it, and what it is. GHCR reads the
# source label and links the package to the repository, so the Index entry,
# the code and the pinned image are one chain a stranger can walk; MIT is a
# condition of ranking on the leaderboard, and the digest is what Plow pins.
